    /// In your plugin, all functionality must be implemented in a class called cPlugin. <para />
    /// This is a convenient base class to inherit from for the creation of such a class.
    /// The plugin must reference the ETABS2016 API library(either ETABS2016.DLL or ETABS2016.TLB ), which must be registered on the developer’s and the user’s systems.
    /// This registration takes place during the installation of ETABS.
    /// The ETABS2016.DLL is compiled as AnyCPU, hence it can be referenced by both 32bit and 64bit plugin projects.
    /// Please note that COM plugins must be registered for COM on the user’s system, before they can be used in ETABS.
    /// This will require that the ETABS2016.DLL be present in the directory where the COM plugin is being registered.
    /// It is the plugin developer's responsibility to instruct users how to install the plugin.
    /// Plugins should be installed only after ETABS has been installed.
    /// COM Plugin developers should consider that registering assemblies usually requires administrative permissions, which many users may not have.
    /// Plugins compiled as 32bit will only work with 32bit ETABS, and likewise for 64bit.
    /// For these reasons, we recommend that developers create.NET plugins that are compiled as "AnyCPU".
    /// This will allow your plugin to be called from both 32bit and 64bit ETABS, and will not require registration.
    /// Please make sure your plugin is stable, handles errors well, and does not cause any unintended changes to the user’s model.
    /// We will attempt to maintain a stable interface in ETABS, however, that cannot be guaranteed, and updates to your plugin may be required for future versions of ETABS.
